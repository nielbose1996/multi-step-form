Introduction
This project is a responsive multi-step form built with React and Material-UI. It guides users through three steps to collect personal information, address details, and confirm the data before submission. The form includes validation, error handling, and data persistence using local storage. It’s designed to be responsive across all screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Features
Multi-Step Navigation: A tabbed navigation at the top allows users to switch between steps, with controls to prevent skipping steps.
Validation: Each step includes client-side validation to ensure required fields are filled out and properly formatted (e.g., 10-digit phone number).
Error Handling: Errors are displayed next to the respective fields, and invalid inputs are highlighted.
State Management: Form data is managed using React’s useState and useEffect hooks.
Local Storage: Form data is saved in local storage to allow users to continue from where they left off if they navigate away or refresh the page.
Responsiveness: The form is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI: React components for faster and easier web development.
Local Storage: For persisting form data across sessions.
CSS: For custom styling and responsive design adjustments.

Components
App.js
This is the main component that manages the overall state of the form and controls the navigation between steps. It also handles the tabbed navigation and retrieval of stored data from local storage.

PersonalInfo.js
This component collects the user's personal information (Name, Email, Phone) and validates each field. Errors are displayed if the input is missing or incorrectly formatted.

AddressInfo.js
This component collects the user's address information (Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Zip Code). Similar to the personal info step, it includes validation and error handling.

Confirmation.js
This component displays all the collected information for the user to review. Users can go back to previous steps to make corrections or submit the form.

Styling
The project uses Material-UI components for styling, ensuring a modern, responsive, and accessible design. The Container, Paper, Box, Tabs, Tab, TextField, Button, and Typography components are used throughout the form.

Example of Custom CSS
css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .MuiContainer-root {
    padding: 0;
  }

  .MuiBox-root {
    padding: 16px;
  }
}
Validation
Each form field includes validation to ensure data integrity. For instance, the phone number is validated to be exactly 10 digits using a regular expression. Validation errors are highlighted next to the respective fields, and users cannot proceed to the next step until all errors are resolved.

Responsiveness
The form is designed to be fully responsive. Material-UI’s grid system and responsive utilities, along with custom media queries, ensure the form looks good and functions well on any screen size.

Local Storage
The form data is stored in local storage as users navigate between steps. This allows users to return to the form later without losing their progress. The data is retrieved and pre-filled when the user revisits the form.

Known Issues
Tab Navigation: Users can navigate between tabs, but only sequential navigation is allowed to prevent skipping steps.
Local Storage Limitations: Since the form data is stored in local storage, it might not be preserved in incognito mode or if the storage is cleared.
Future Enhancements
Form Submission API Integration: Connect the form submission to an API for backend processing.
Enhanced UX: Implement animations or transitions between steps to improve user experience.
Dynamic Validation: Add more complex validation logic, such as checking for existing email addresses in a database.
Conclusion
This multi-step form project demonstrates a practical implementation of React with Material-UI for creating a responsive, user-friendly form. It covers essential frontend development skills, including state management, form validation, error handling, and responsive design.
